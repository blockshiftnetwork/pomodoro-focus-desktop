   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow conventional commits for clear and consistent commit messages:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting)
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - Code change that improves performance
- `test:` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Code Style

#### TypeScript/React
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use functional components and React Hooks

#### Rust
- Follow the Rust style guide
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` and fix any warnings
- Write documentation for public APIs

### Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash

   bun run tauri build
   ```

2. Test the application manually to ensure:
   - Timer functionality works correctly
   - Tasks can be created, edited, and deleted
   - Statistics are calculated properly
   - No console errors or warnings

### Submitting Your Pull Request
